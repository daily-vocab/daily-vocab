    Hey! Welcome to daily-vocab. Created (still a work in progress though) to
    help with my French Learning Journey. The basic idea is this - create a
    place where you can add new words you're learning in your target language,
    along with how you can use it in a sentence; and maybe some notes as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you've added a certain amount of words, the app can present you with
    game (a matching sort of a game) to help you remember these words. This,
    improving your vocabulary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The daily part comes in - to help you make this a daily habit by reminding
    you to add a new word everyday.
  </p>

    Would love to hear your thoughts - <a
